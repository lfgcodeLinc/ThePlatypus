This is all the code from the codeLinc 2014 event. We built a website off of wordpress.org
and each file here is the source code for each page on the website. We used the Customizr theme.

The Main Home has 3 sites connected to it: Students, Parents, Teachers. Each have their own 3 pages.

Thank you for a great event.
Email ekwiatkowski@elon.edu with any questions.
